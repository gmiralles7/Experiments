# PET Scan

In this experiment I will use positron emission tomography to identify the positions and relative intensities of two unknown positron emitters inside a sealed box. Specifically, goals for this experiment include the following:

to understand the formation of positronium and the annihilation of electron-positron pairs;
to interpret the physical meaning of a one-dimensional coincidence scan
to understand how one-dimensional scans are combined into a two-dimensional image
to investigate what factors affect scan results, and the limitations of the results.
to use knowledge of the method to locate areas of high positron emissions in an unknown sample, and estimate their relative intensity.
(The last goal here represents a typical use case for PET scanning: a chemical called Fluorodeoxyglucose that contains Fluorine-18 is administered to a patient, which the body treats as regular glucose. Cells with rapid metabolisms (e.g. cancer) take in glucose much more rapidly than other tissues, and thus will end up with higher concentrations of beta-emitting 
18 F.)
